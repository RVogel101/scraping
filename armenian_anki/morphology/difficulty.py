"""
Word difficulty component analysis for Armenian vocabulary progression.

Scores word complexity based on morphological and phonological factors:
  - Syllable count (including hidden vowels in certain grammatical contexts)
  - Declension class regularity (noun)
  - Verb conjugation class (weak/irregular)
  - Affix stacking (number of morpheme boundaries)
  - Phonological complexity (rare consonant clusters, fricatives)

The difficulty_score() function returns a composite score (1.0–10.0) where
higher = more difficult. This is used to supplement frequency-based ordering
when present, ensuring learners encounter simpler morphological patterns first.
